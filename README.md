#Weatherpy
In this activity we used a weather API in order to find relationships between latitude and Temperature,Humidity,Cloudiness, and Wind Seed.
We found that only temperature had a strong relationship with the latitude. Showing that the closer the location was to equator the higher the max temperature.

#Vacation
In this activity we used a geoapify API in order to find certain locations and display them on a map.
We also applied conditions in order to narrow down certain cities we watched using data from the previous activity.
After narrowing down the cities we were able to access the API in order to find the closest hotel from that location.
Last we were able to make a new map that showed use the cities we wanted and added a hover to show country and hotel.
